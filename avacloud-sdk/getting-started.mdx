### AvaCloud SDK ###
The AvaCloud SDK provides web3 application developers with multi-chain data related to Avalanche's primary network, Avalanche Subnets, and Ethereum. With Glacier, you can easily build products that leverage real-time and historical transaction and transfer history, native and token balances, and various types of token metadata.

### SDK Installation ###
<CodeGroup>
``` npm NPM
npm add @avalabs/avacloud-sdk
```
``` pnpm PNPM
pnpm add @avalabs/avacloud-sdk
```
```bun Bun
bun add @avalabs/avacloud-sdk
```
``` yarn Yarn
yarn add @avalabs/avacloud-sdk zod

# Note that Yarn does not install peer dependencies automatically. You will need
# to install zod as shown above.
```
</CodeGroup>


### SDK Example Usage ###

```javascript
import { AvaCloudSDK } from "@avalabs/avacloud-sdk";

const avaCloudSDK = new AvaCloudSDK({
    apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>",
    chainId: "43114",
    network: "mainnet",
});

async function run() {
    const result = await avaCloudSDK.metrics.healthCheck.metricsHealthCheck();

    // Handle the result
    console.log(result);
