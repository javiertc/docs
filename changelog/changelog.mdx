### New endpoint - Get subnet details by subnetID ###
August 6th, 2024
**Get Subnet Details by ID**

Endpoint: GET https://glacier-api.avax.network/v1/networks/{network}/subnets/{subnetId}

This endpoint retrieves detailed information about a specific subnet registered on the network. By providing the network type (mainnet or a testnet) and the subnet ID, you can fetch various details including the subnetâ€™s creation timestamp, ownership information, and associated blockchains.

Example response:

```JSON
{
  "createBlockTimestamp": 1599696000,
  "createBlockIndex": "-1",
  "subnetId": "11111111111111111111111111111111LpoYY",
  "ownerAddresses": [
    ""
  ],
  "threshold": 0,
  "locktime": 0,
  "subnetOwnershipInfo": {
