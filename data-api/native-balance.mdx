**Step 1: Set Up AvaCloud**

Begin by reading the article Setting Up AvaCloud: Getting Started and ensure you complete all the steps outlined there. It is essential to finish this setup before proceeding with the rest of this guide.

**Step 2: Retrieve the Native Balance of an Address**

To obtain the native balance of a wallet address, AvaCloud offers the Get Native Token Balance API endpoint.

Youâ€™ll need two parameters: chainId and address.

Once you have both the address and chain ID, use the following command:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://glacier-api.avax.network/v1/chains/{chainId}/addresses/{address}/balances:getNative
```

Response
```json
{
  "nativeTokenBalance": {
    "chainId": "43114",
    "name": "Avalanche",
    "symbol": "AVAX",
    "decimals": 18,
    "price": {
      "currencyCode": "usd",
      "value": 26.32
    },
    "balance": "3316667947990566036",
    "balanceValue": {
      "currencyCode": "usd",
      "value": 87.29
    },
