### What is the Data API?
The Data API provides web3 application developers with multi-chain data related to Avalanche's primary network, Avalanche L1s, and Ethereum. With the Data API, you can easily build products that leverage real-time and historical transaction and transfer history, native and token balances, and various types of token metadata.

The [Data API](/data-api), along with the [Metrics API](/metrics-api), are the engines behind the [Avalanche Explorer](https://subnets.avax.network/stats/) and the [Core wallet](https://core.app/en/). They are used to display transactions, logs, balances, NFTs, and more. The data and visualizations presented are all powered by these APIs, offering real-time and historical insights that are essential for building sophisticated, data-driven blockchain products.

### Features
