The Metrics API is designed to provide developers with powerful tools to analyze and monitor on-chain activity across Avalanche’s primary network, Avalanche L1s, and other supported EVM chains. Below is an overview of the key features available:

### Chain Throughput Metrics
- **Gas Consumption** <br />
  Track the average and maximum gas consumption per second, helping to understand network performance and efficiency.

### Rolling Window Analytics
- **Short-Term and Long-Term Metrics:** Perform rolling window analysis on various metrics like gas used, TPS, and gas prices, allowing for both short-term and long-term trend analysis.
- **Customizable Time Frames:** Choose from different time intervals (hourly, daily, monthly) to suit your specific analytical needs.

### Blockchain and L1 Information
- **Chain and L1 Mapping:** Get detailed information about EVM chains and their associated L1s, including chain IDs, blockchain IDs, and subnet IDs, facilitating cross-chain analytics.

### Advanced Composite Queries
- **Custom Metrics Combinations**: Combine multiple metrics and apply logical operators to perform sophisticated queries, enabling deep insights and tailored analytics.
- **Paginated Results:** Handle large datasets efficiently with paginated responses, ensuring seamless data retrieval in your applications.

The Metrics API equips developers with the tools needed to build robust analytics, monitoring, and reporting solutions, leveraging the full power of multi-chain data across the Avalanche ecosystem and beyond.
