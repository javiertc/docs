The Metrics API is designed to provide developers with powerful tools to analyze and monitor on-chain activity across Avalanche’s primary network, Avalanche Subnets, and other supported EVM chains. Below is an overview of the key features available:

**Chain Throughput Metrics**
- **Gas Consumption:** Track the average and maximum gas consumption per second, helping to understand network performance and efficiency.
- **Transactions Per Second (TPS):** Monitor the average and peak TPS to assess the network’s capacity and utilization.
- **Gas Prices:** Analyze average and maximum gas prices over time to optimize transaction costs and predict fee trends.

**Cumulative Metrics**
- **Address Growth:** Access the cumulative number of active addresses on a chain, providing insights into network adoption and user activity.
- **Contract Deployment:** Monitor the cumulative number of smart contracts deployed, helping to gauge developer engagement and platform usage.
- **Transaction Count:** Track the cumulative number of transactions, offering a clear view of network activity and transaction volume.

**Staking Information**
- **Validator and Delegator Counts:** Retrieve the number of active validators and delegators for a given subnet, crucial for understanding network security and decentralization.
- **Staking Weights:** Access the total stake weight of validators and delegators, helping to assess the distribution of staked assets across the network.

**Rolling Window Analytics**
- **Short-Term and Long-Term Metrics:** Perform rolling window analysis on various metrics like gas used, TPS, and gas prices, allowing for both short-term and long-term trend analysis.
- **Customizable Time Frames:** Choose from different time intervals (hourly, daily, monthly) to suit your specific analytical needs.

**Blockchain and Subnet Information**
- **Chain and Subnet Mapping:** Get detailed information about EVM chains and their associated subnets, including chain IDs, blockchain IDs, and subnet IDs, facilitating cross-chain analytics.

**Advanced Composite Queries**
- **Custom Metrics Combinations**: Combine multiple metrics and apply logical operators to perform sophisticated queries, enabling deep insights and tailored analytics.
- **Paginated Results:** Handle large datasets efficiently with paginated responses, ensuring seamless data retrieval in your applications.

The Metrics API equips developers with the tools needed to build robust analytics, monitoring, and reporting solutions, leveraging the full power of multi-chain data across the Avalanche ecosystem and beyond.
