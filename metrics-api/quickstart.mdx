### What is the Metrics API? ###

The Metrics API provides web3 application developers with comprehensive metrics and analytics related to on-chain activity across Avalancheâ€™s primary network, Avalanche L1s, and other supported EVM chains. With the Metrics API, you can easily build products that leverage real-time and historical data on transactions, gas consumption, throughput, staking, and more.

### API Features ###
- **Chain Throughput:** Retrieve detailed metrics on gas consumption, transactions per second (TPS), and gas prices, including rolling windows of data for granular analysis.
- **Cumulative Metrics:** Access cumulative data on addresses, contracts, deployers, and transaction counts, providing insights into network growth over time.
- **Staking Information:** Obtain staking-related data, including the number of validators and delegators, along with their respective weights, across different subnets.
- **Blockchains and Subnets:** Get information about supported blockchains, including EVM Chain IDs, blockchain IDs, and subnet associations, facilitating multi-chain analytics.
- **Composite Queries:** Perform advanced queries by combining different metric types and conditions, enabling detailed and customizable data retrieval.

This API is designed to support developers in building advanced analytics and monitoring tools, leveraging the power of multi-chain data.
