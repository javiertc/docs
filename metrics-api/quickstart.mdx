### What is the Metrics API? ###

The Metrics API equips web3 developers with a robust suite of tools to access and analyze on-chain activity across Avalancheâ€™s primary network, Avalanche L1s, and other supported EVM chains. This API delivers comprehensive metrics and analytics, enabling you to seamlessly integrate historical data on transactions, gas consumption, throughput, staking, and more into your applications.

The Metrics API, along with the [Glacier API](/data-api) are the driving force behind every graph you see on the [Avalanche Explorer](https://subnets.avax.network/stats/). From transaction trends to staking insights, the visualizations and data presented are all powered by these APIs, offering real-time and historical insights that are essential for building sophisticated, data-driven blockchain products..

### API Features ###
- **Chain Throughput:** Retrieve detailed metrics on gas consumption, transactions per second (TPS), and gas prices, including rolling windows of data for granular analysis.
- **Cumulative Metrics:** Access cumulative data on addresses, contracts, deployers, and transaction counts, providing insights into network growth over time.
- **Staking Information:** Obtain staking-related data, including the number of validators and delegators, along with their respective weights, across different subnets.
- **Blockchains and Subnets:** Get information about supported blockchains, including EVM Chain IDs, blockchain IDs, and subnet associations, facilitating multi-chain analytics.
- **Composite Queries:** Perform advanced queries by combining different metric types and conditions, enabling detailed and customizable data retrieval.

This API is designed to support developers in building advanced analytics and monitoring tools, leveraging the power of multi-chain data.
