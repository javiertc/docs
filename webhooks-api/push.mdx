To make your webhooks extra secure, you can verify that they originated from AvaCloud by generating an HMAC SHA-256 hash code using your Authentication Token and request body. You can get the signing secret through the AvaCloud portal or Glacier API.

Find your signing secret
Using the AvaCloud portal

Navigate to the webhook section and click on Generate Signing Secret. Create the secret and copy it to your code.

Using Glacier API

```bash
curl --location 'https://glacier-api.avax.network/v1/webhooks:getSharedSecret' \
--header 'x-glacier-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
```

Validate the signature received
Every outbound request will include an authentication signature in the header. This signature is generated by:

Canonicalizing the JSON Payload: This means arranging the JSON data in a standard format.
Generating a Hash: Using the HMAC SHA256 hash algorithm to create a hash of the canonicalized JSON payload.
To verify that the signature is from AvaCloud, follow these steps:

Generate the HMAC SHA256 hash of the received JSON payload.
Compare this generated hash with the signature in the request header.
This process, known as verifying the digital signature, ensures the authenticity and integrity of the request.
